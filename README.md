# Hey, I'm Taara, how's it going? 👋
_Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a RMIT International Business Graduate and a former 5G Networks Ltd Billing & Accounts Receivable Officer passionate about exploring and analysing data to obtain insights and suggest actionable recommendations._ 

## About Me 👩🏻‍🦰

👩🏻‍💻 I’m currently working on becoming a **Data Analyst**.

🌱 I'm learning **Excel**, **SQL**, **Python** and **Tableau**.

👀 Fun fact: My favorite part of the data analysis process is transforming a basic, boring report into an engaging and visually appealing one that's easy to understand.

## Featured Projects 📊

Here are a few of the projects I’ve worked on:

📈 **Project 1: Amazon Discount Impact on Sales and Customer Analysis** – Investigate how discounts are distributed to uncover their influence on product ratings, sales performance, and customer satisfaction, and then offer actionable insights and recommendations.

📉 **Project 2: PwC Customer Churn Analysis** – Perform EDA on customer demographics and behaviors, then building a churn prediction model to identify key risk factors and inform retention strategies.

Feel free to check them out and contribute!
